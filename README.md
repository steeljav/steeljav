# About
I'm an electrical engineer by education but worked as a software engineer for a few years and have gotten a lot of mileage out of the experience. Lately I have developed the following:

- A three-phase electric arc furnace (EAF) model and simulation that incorporates the power supply from the transmission through the arcs. It is capable of calculating all electrical parameters of interest for all EAF operating conditions. This was originally developed using VBA and Excel in order to share with customers, but has been converted to python.
- A java program to continuously read measurements from industrial PLCs and upload to AWS S3.
- Java and R software to perform statistical processing of power system measurements.
- A flask application to provide visualization of EAF measurements.
- An R based application to perform statistical testing of EAF measurements.
- A python application to generate pdf based standardized reports of EAF performance.
- An EAF control system in C.
- A numerical optimization system in python.

All of my experince has been on Linux and FreeBSD.


# Stuff I Use
vim, Pycharm, Intelij, CLion, Postgres, SQLite, logseq, MacOS, FreeBSD, Linux
